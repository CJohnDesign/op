After the visit, the provider will send the remaining medical bills to MBR for repricing. \n\nTo receive insured benefits, members must complete insurance claim forms, which can be provided by the MBR team along with instructions. Once the bills are submitted for repricing, both the member and the healthcare provider will receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from MBR, detailing the billed amount and any discounts applied. Finally, members will receive a final bill from their medical provider, which should match the amount on the EOB. The insurance company may offer additional funds to cover any outstanding balances. The MBR team is available to assist throughout the entire process.",

To maximize savings, it is recommended to choose a network physician.\n\nThe program utilizes PPO Networks, Reference-Based Pricing, and Direct Bill Negotiation to help lower medical bills. However, it is important to note that while MBR strives to assist, it cannot guarantee the outcome of any claim or the amount of savings on any bill. A majority of the time, MBR reprices bills to amounts exceeding Medicare's allowable rate, but medical providers may still decline to honor this service. For assistance, providers can contact MBR at the provided phone number.\n\nTo locate a PHCS network provider, individuals can call the specified number or visit the website.

Termination of the certificate and any attached riders occurs on the earliest of several specified dates, such as the policy termination date, the date the premium becomes due after the grace period, or when the insured no longer qualifies. Additionally, coverage may end upon the insured's death, with APL potentially covering claims submitted before this event. Riders are subject to all policy provisions and must not conflict with existing terms.\n\nThe document also details a Portability Option Rider, allowing insured individuals to continue coverage under specific conditions unrelated to premium non-payment. This option requires a rider attached to the certificate, and APL will notify the insured of any changes in premium amounts or due dates. Furthermore, the Continuity of Coverage Amendment Rider provides continuity for those previously covered under a different group hospital indemnity plan. This continuity is limited to benefits under the new policy and does not cover losses incurred before the effective date. Employees not previously enrolled must meet all APL policy requirements.\n\nThe policy includes limitations, exclusions, and a waiting period, and is not suitable for individuals eligible for Medicaid. It is considered an employee welfare benefit plan under ERISA guidelines, with specific tax implications if premiums are paid pre-tax.",

      "summary": "The MedChoice\u2122 Group Hospital Indemnity Insurance plan outlines specific conditions under which coverage may be terminated. Coverage ends on the earliest of several dates: the policy termination date, the end of the grace period if premiums remain unpaid, or when the insured no longer qualifies. Additionally, coverage for riders ends under similar conditions, including the policy termination date and the end of the premium grace period. The policy also allows for termination upon written request from the insured or upon the insured's death. \n\nThe plan includes provisions for additional riders, which are subject to all policy terms and conditions. A portability option is available, allowing insured individuals to continue coverage under certain conditions, such as leaving the policy for reasons other than non-payment. This option requires a rider and notification to APL about premium details. \n\nContinuity of coverage is addressed, allowing insured individuals and their dependents to qualify for coverage credit for limitations served under prior group hospital indemnity coverage. This continuity is limited to benefits provided under the new policy and does not cover losses incurred before the effective date. The policy explicitly states that it is inappropriate for individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage and is governed by ERISA guidelines.",

    "content": "---- Cover ----\n\nHello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on the Business Workers of America Association. We'll walk through the association's benefits and details, designed to support your health and well-being. Let's get started!\n\n---- Business Workers of America Association Overview ----\n\nThe Business Workers of America Association was founded in 2001 as a not-for-profit member association. \n\nIt provides healthcare and supplemental benefits for its members, ensuring access to essential services. \n\nThe association also offers wellness programs aimed at improving family health. \n\nIn addition, there is educational support available through scholarships and grants. \n\nFinally, the association engages in legislative advocacy to promote a better lifestyle and lower healthcare costs.\n\nNow, let's explore the key features and benefits.\n\n---- Key Features and Benefits ----\n\nThe association offers a range of healthcare benefits tailored to meet diverse needs. \n\nEducational support is provided to help members and their families achieve their academic goals. \n\nLegislative advocacy is a key focus, working towards better living conditions and reduced healthcare expenses. \n\nWellness programs are available, varying by plan, to promote overall health. \n\nAdditionally, members can enjoy prescription savings through HealthWarehouse.com.\n\nLet's move on to the cost management tools.\n\n---- Cost Management Tools ----\n\nThe Medical Bill Repricer, or MBR, is a valuable tool for managing healthcare expenses. \n\nThe reference-based pricing system helps ensure fair pricing for medical services. \n\nDirect bill negotiation support is also available to assist with managing healthcare costs.\n\nNext, we'll see how the Medical Bill Repricer works.\n\n---- How Medical Bill Repricer Works ----\n\nTo use the Medical Bill Repricer, you first enroll through the Business Workers of America Association. \n\nPresent your MBR card at the provider's office to access services. \n\nYou'll pre-pay twenty-five dollars for primary care and fifty dollars for specialists. \n\nAfter your visit, you'll receive an Explanation of Benefits, or EOB, detailing the costs. \n\nThe final bill you receive will match the EOB, ensuring transparency. \n\nIn many cases, insurance may cover the remaining balance.\n\nLet's discuss preventive care and wellness.\n\n---- Preventive Care and Wellness ----\n\nThe association offers wellness program services to support your health. \n\nEducational seminars are available to provide valuable health information. \n\nDirectLabs provides lab services to help monitor and maintain your well-being.\n\nNow, let's talk about telehealth services.\n\n---- Telehealth Services ----\n\nMembers have access to a twenty-four/seven nurse hotline for immediate assistance. \n\nAn online health manager is available to help you track and manage your health. \n\nTelemedicine consultations offer convenient access to healthcare professionals. \n\nRemote access to care ensures you can receive support wherever you are.\n\nLet's move on to advocacy and support services.\n\n---- Advocacy and Support Services ----\n\nThe association provides white glove healthcare advocacy to assist members. \n\nManaged care assistance is available to help navigate healthcare options. \n\nFinancial counseling options are offered to support financial well-being. \n\nA legal plan is also available to provide legal support when needed.\n\nNow, let's examine our first plan tier.\n\n---- Plan 2 (One of Two) ----\n\nPlan 2 offers hospital benefits, including seven hundred fifty dollars per day for admission, two hundred dollars per day for confinement, one thousand five hundred dollars per day for ICU admission, and three hundred fifty dollars per day for ICU confinement. \n\nSurgery benefits include five hundred dollars per day for inpatient procedures and three hundred dollars per day for outpatient procedures. \n\nOutpatient benefits cover two hundred dollars per day for ER visits, fifty dollars per day for urgent care, and fifty dollars per day for physician visits.\n\nContinuing with our first plan tier.\n\n---- Plan 2 (Two of Two) ----\n\nTherapy benefits in Plan 2 include fifteen dollars per day for therapy sessions. \n\nAdditional riders include a portability option and no occupational exclusion.\n\nNow, let's look at our second plan tier.\n\n---- Plan 3 (One of Two) ----\n\nPlan 3 provides hospital benefits with one thousand dollars per day for admission, three hundred dollars per day for confinement, two thousand dollars per day for ICU admission, and five hundred dollars per day for ICU confinement. \n\nSurgery benefits remain at five hundred dollars per day for inpatient and three hundred dollars per day for outpatient procedures. \n\nOutpatient benefits include three hundred dollars per day for ER visits, fifty dollars per day for urgent care, and fifty dollars per day for physician visits.\n\nContinuing with our second plan tier.\n\n---- Plan 3 (Two of Two) ----\n\nTherapy benefits in Plan 3 also include fifteen dollars per day for therapy sessions. \n\nAdditional riders feature a portability option and no occupational exclusion.\n\nNow, let's look at our third plan tier.\n\n---- Plan 4 (One of Two) ----\n\nPlan 4 offers hospital benefits with two thousand dollars per day for admission, five hundred dollars per day for confinement, two thousand dollars per day for ICU admission, and five hundred dollars per day for ICU confinement. \n\nSurgery benefits increase to seven hundred fifty dollars per day for inpatient and four hundred dollars per day for outpatient procedures. \n\nOutpatient benefits cover five hundred dollars per day for ER visits, seventy-five dollars per day for urgent care, and seventy-five dollars per day for physician visits.\n\nContinuing with our third plan tier.\n\n---- Plan 4 (Two of Two) ----\n\nTherapy benefits in Plan 4 include seventy-five dollars per day for therapy sessions. \n\nAdditional riders include a portability option and no occupational exclusion.\n\nLet's compare the different tiers available.\n\n---- Comparing Plan Tiers ----\n\nIn this table, we compare the key features of each plan tier. \n\nPlan 2 offers seven hundred fifty dollars per day for hospital admission, while Plan 3 provides one thousand dollars, and Plan 4 offers two thousand dollars. \n\nHospital confinement benefits range from two hundred dollars per day in Plan 2 to five hundred dollars in Plan 4. \n\nICU admission benefits are one thousand five hundred dollars per day in Plan 2, increasing to two thousand dollars in Plans 3 and 4. \n\nICU confinement benefits are three hundred fifty dollars per day in Plan 2 and five hundred dollars in Plans 3 and 4. \n\nSurgery inpatient benefits are five hundred dollars per day in Plans 2 and 3, with Plan 4 offering seven hundred fifty dollars.\n\nLet's review important definitions and limitations.\n\n---- Definitions and Limitations ----\n\nHospital benefits are limited to specific days and exclude certain conditions, requiring network providers. \n\nSurgery benefits are limited to specific procedures and exclude cosmetic surgeries. \n\nOutpatient benefits are limited to specific visits and exclude certain treatments. \n\nTherapy benefits are limited to specific therapies and exclude experimental treatments.\n\nHere are the key points to remember.\n\n---- Key Takeaways and Reminders ----\n\nThe association offers a wide range of benefits for its members. \n\nEducational support is included to help members achieve their academic goals. \n\nAdvocacy services provide valuable support and assistance. \n\nRemember, network providers are required for accessing these benefits.\n\n---- Closing ----\n\nThank you for your time today. We hope this information helps you make informed decisions about your health coverage. Continue to be great!",
