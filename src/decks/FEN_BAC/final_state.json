The election of portability requires adherence to specific requirements detailed in the rider. Continuity of coverage is also addressed, allowing for credit for limitations served under prior coverage. This continuity is limited to benefits provided under the prior group hospital indemnity coverage and does not include losses incurred before the effective date of the new coverage. Employees must meet all APL policy requirements to qualify.\n\nThe document also notes that the insurance is inappropriate for individuals eligible for Medicaid and is considered an employee welfare benefit plan under ERISA.
