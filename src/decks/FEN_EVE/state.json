specified.\n\nAdditional wellness tools are not outlined in this tier.\n\nPremium benefits include surgery benefits for three days per certificate year and twenty-five percent anesthesia coverage.\n\n---- Comparing Plan Tiers ----\n\nLet's compare the different tiers available.\n\nHospital benefits vary across tiers, with Plan 100 offering one hundred dollars per day and Plan 1000 offering one thousand dollars per day for hospital confinement.\n\nPhysician visit coverage ranges from three to five visits per certificate year, depending on the tier.\n\nEmergency services are
