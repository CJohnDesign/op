An eligible person becomes qualified for insurance on the date they meet all the requirements of one of the covered classes. It is specified that an individual may only be insured under one covered class, even if they qualify for more than one. The effective date for insurance coverage is determined by the schedule of benefits. This includes the effective date of the policyholder's participation and the date the individual becomes eligible based on policyholder requirements. Additionally, any new individuals added to the classes of eligible persons in the schedule of benefits are also eligible for insurance under the policy.",

      "summary": "This document outlines the conditions of coverage under the insurance policy, specifically focusing on the 24-hour coverage provision. The company commits to paying the benefit amount as specified in the Schedule of Benefits. This payment is contingent upon the insured person experiencing a covered loss at any time while insured by the policy. The coverage includes incidents occurring while riding in, entering, or exiting an aircraft. However, the payment of benefits is subject to all applicable conditions and exclusions, which are not detailed in this section but are implied to be part of the broader policy documentation. The emphasis on 24-hour coverage suggests a comprehensive approach to ensuring protection around the clock, though specific exclusions and conditions apply.",

The plan provides benefits for covered losses resulting from a covered accident, with the company paying the benefit amount for the largest applicable loss. Accidental death benefits are paid up to the principal sum, subject to conditions and exclusions. Accident medical expenses are covered as per the schedule of benefits, with deductibles and covered expenses clearly defined. \n\nThe document specifies that benefits will be paid when covered expenses exceed any applicable deductible within a specified period from the date of the covered injury. The company will not pay more than the maximum benefit amount, and expenses must be incurred within the maximum benefit period. The co-insurance percentage is applied to determine the amount payable, and limits may be imposed on certain types of expenses. \n\nLimitations and exclusions are detailed, including non-duplication of benefits, where benefits are reduced if other insurance covers the insured person. The document emphasizes that benefits will not exceed the expenses for services provided, and the company is not defined as primary under other insurance coordination provisions.",

Insurance will end on the earliest of several specified events: when the person is no longer in an eligible class, when the person enters full-time active duty in the Armed Forces, at the end of the period for which the last premium is made, or on the policy's termination date. If the insured enters active duty, the company will refund any premium paid for that period, excluding Reserve or National Guard duty for training. Termination does not affect claims for covered losses due to accidents occurring before the termination date, but benefits will not extend beyond the end of the benefit period or the date benefits equal any applicable benefit limit as shown in the schedule of benefits.\n\nThe policy also details cancellation provisions. The company or policyholder may cancel the policy after the first year or policy term by providing written or electronic notice. Cancellation or non-renewal by the company can occur for reasons such as non-payment of premium, fraud, misrepresentation, failure to comply with policy provisions, or poor claims experience. If a premium is not paid when due, the company will cancel the policy at the end of the last period for which the premium was paid, subject to the grace period provision. Cancellation does not affect claims for covered losses occurring before the cancellation date.",

The exclusions include self-inflicted injuries, suicide, or any attempt while sane or insane. It also covers participation in felonies, riots, or insurrections, and any act of war unless specifically provided by the policy. The document specifies that intoxication as determined by local laws, voluntary ingestion of narcotics unless prescribed, and injuries occurring during active military service are excluded from coverage. Additionally, injuries from flying in non-commercial aircraft, bacterial infections from accidental cuts, and medical mishaps are not covered unless they occur during treatment of a covered injury.\n\nFurther exclusions include injuries sustained while operating a motor vehicle without a valid license, and expenses covered by automobile insurance policies. The document also states that benefits will not be paid for services rendered by individuals employed by the policyholder, residents of the same household, immediate family members, or the insured person themselves. These exclusions are critical in understanding the limitations and restrictions of the policy, ensuring that policyholders are aware of the specific scenarios where coverage is not applicable.",

The document specifies that a deductible must be satisfied before benefits are payable. A corridor deductible is also mentioned, which applies to covered medical services before benefits become payable. Each covered injury requires a separate deductible.\n\nHospital miscellaneous expenses are defined as necessary treatment expenses charged by a hospital or ambulatory surgical center for outpatient surgery. These expenses include, but are not limited to, those listed in the schedule of benefits and necessary charges other than room and board during a hospital stay. The document also addresses other insurance, stating that reimbursement for covered injuries from other sources is not allowed, except for gifts and donations. Specific exclusions include benefits from accident or disability insurance, social security disability benefits, and any government-sponsored benefits.\n\nPre-existing conditions are defined as diseases or physical conditions for which the insured person received medical advice or treatment during the 24 months before the effective date of coverage. These conditions may be excluded until 24 months after the effective date of coverage, provided no medical advice or treatment is received during this period, or until the second anniversary of the effective date of coverage.",

In such cases, a pro rata share of the total amount of covered expenses is paid, ensuring that the total benefits do not exceed 100% of the covered expenses. The pro rata share is calculated based on the total benefits payable under this policy and any other insurance for the same covered injury.\n\nThe document also details a list of excluded expenses that will not be considered covered unless specifically provided. These exclusions include injuries sustained while participating in professional athletics, routine physical care, dental care, immunizations, cosmetic or plastic surgery not resulting from a covered injury, and routine nursery or childcare. Additionally, mental or nervous disorders, pre-existing conditions, and non-recommended services or treatments are excluded. Other exclusions include charges for medical expenses not responsible under this policy, expenses paid by other insurance, and injuries covered by worker's compensation.\n\nFurther exclusions cover treatments in government facilities, services by non-charging providers, and specific treatments like hernia repair. The document also defines key terms such as 'Benefit Period' and 'Covered Expenses,' which include inpatient hospital services like room and board, intensive care, and emergency room services. Other exclusions and limitations are referenced in the common exclusions section of the policy.",

It specifies a grace period of 31 days for the payment of each premium after the first one. During this grace period, the policy remains active, but if the premium is not paid by the end of this period, the coverage will be terminated. Premiums are expressed in U.S. currency and are based on the rates set forth in the Premium Rate Table, which considers the plan and insurance amounts for insured persons. Notifications regarding premiums due or changes will be sent to the policyholder's most current address on file.\n\nThe total premium is calculated as the sum of premiums for all insured persons and is due on the policy effective date unless otherwise agreed upon. If a premium is not paid on time, the policy will be canceled as of the premium due date, except as provided by the grace period. Premium rates may be guaranteed for one year, during which no changes can be made unless specific conditions occur, such as changes in policy terms or significant changes in the number of insured persons.\n\nPremium rate changes can occur under several conditions, including policy changes, significant changes in the number of insured persons, or regulatory changes.

The policyholder may apply for reinstatement by submitting a written application that meets the company's satisfaction. Additionally, the policyholder must pay all overdue premiums to be considered for reinstatement. Any premium accepted during the reinstatement process will be applied to a period for which the premium was not previously paid. However, it is important to note that this reinstatement will not cover any period more than 60 days prior to the date of reinstatement. This ensures that coverage is only applied to recent lapses and not extended to long-standing gaps in premium payment.",

It specifies that the beneficiary is the person or persons named by the insured on a form approved by the insurer. The beneficiary can be changed in writing or electronically, and the change becomes effective upon execution by the insured. The insurer is not liable for actions taken before the change is recorded. If multiple beneficiaries are named, their interests are equal unless specified otherwise. In the absence of a named beneficiary, payment is made to the first surviving class of relatives, including spouse, children, parents, siblings, or the insured's estate.\n\nThe document also details the process for filing claims. Upon receiving notice of a claim, the insurer will send the claimant the necessary forms. If forms are not returned within 15 days, the claim is considered valid if proof of loss is provided within the specified time. Written notice of a claim must be given within 30 days of the loss, including details such as the policyholder's name and policy number. Payment of claims is made to the beneficiary upon receipt of proof of death or loss. If the insured dies before payment, the amount is paid to the beneficiary as per the beneficiary provision.\n\nAdditionally, the document includes an economic sanctions provision, stating that the insurance does not apply where trade or economic sanctions prohibit claim payments. It also specifies that if a payee is a minor or incompetent, payment is made to the legal guardian.",

It specifies that any payment made by the company in good faith fully discharges liability to the extent of the payment made. The 'Time of Payment of Claims' section states that benefits for any loss covered by the policy, other than those with periodic payments, will be paid immediately after satisfactory written proof is received. Legal actions to recover benefits must be initiated within 60 days after proof of loss is furnished, and no action can be brought after three years from the time proof of loss is required.\n\nThe policy grants the company the right to have any insured person examined during a claim and to perform an autopsy if not forbidden by law. Proof of loss must be submitted within 90 days, and the company will not deny claims if proof is provided as soon as reasonably possible. Subrogation rights allow the company to recover benefits paid if the insured is compensated by a third party. The insured must cooperate fully in asserting these rights, and any recovery exceeding actual damages will be refunded to the company.\n\nThe 'Recovery of Overpayment' section details the company's right to recover overpaid amounts through lump sum payments or reductions in future payments. The company has 18 months to recover overpayments from healthcare providers and 12 months from claimants, with exceptions for fraud or misrepresentation. If an overpayment is due upon the insured's death, recovery may be sought from the estate.",

No benefits are payable for expenses incurred before the policy effective date.\n\n'Covered Activity' includes any activity listed in the Schedule of Benefits that meets specified conditions. 'Covered Death' results directly from a covered accident, independent of other causes, and must occur within the applicable time period. 'Covered Injury' is an accidental bodily injury sustained by the insured, resulting from a covered accident, and must also occur within the specified time period. A 'Covered Loss' results from a covered injury or death, with benefits payable under the policy. It includes expenses for services or supplies obtained by the insured when covered by the policy.\n\nThe document also defines 'Eligible Person' as an individual outlined in the Schedule of Benefits, and 'Home Country' as the country from which the insured holds a passport. A 'Hospital' is defined as an institution meeting specific requirements, such as operating under state or provincial law and primarily caring for sick or injured inpatients.",

Termination occurs on the earliest of several events: the insured is no longer in an eligible class, enters full-time active duty in the Armed Forces, the end of the period for which the last premium is made, or the policy's end date. Importantly, termination does not affect claims for covered losses due to accidents occurring before the termination date. Benefits will not extend beyond the end of the benefit period or the date benefits equal any applicable benefit limit as shown in the schedule of benefits.\n\nThe policy also details cancellation provisions. The company or policyholder may cancel the policy after the first year or policy term with prior written or electronic notice. Cancellation by the company can occur due to non-payment of premium, fraud, failure to comply with policy provisions, or poor claims performance. If a premium is unpaid, the policy will be canceled at the end of the last paid period, subject to the grace period provision. Cancellation does not affect claims for covered losses occurring before the cancellation date.",
