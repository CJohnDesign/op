Covered expenses payable under this provision will be reduced by the amount the health care plan would have paid if its services or facilities had been utilized, particularly if the covered person has coverage under another health care plan, the other health care plan is an HMO, PPO, or similar arrangement, or the covered person does not use the facilities or services of the HMO, PPO, or similar arrangement.\n\nThe plan offers an Accident Medical Expense Annual Maximum Benefit of $10,000 per year. It is available to all active members of the United Business Association, ages 18-79, who have chosen to enroll in the Gap10000 Product option, along with their enrolled spouse up to age 70 and their enrolled dependent children. Additional details include a loss period of 90 days after the covered accident or injury and a benefit period of 365 days from the date of the covered accident or injury, provided the injury occurs prior to the expiration date and the covered person receives appropriate treatment. The deductible is set at $100 for each covered accident.\n\nThe document emphasizes that covered expenses payable will not be reduced for emergency treatment within 24 hours after a covered accident that occurred outside the geographic service area of the HMO, PPO, or similar arrangement.

If the diagnosis occurs after the first year, the benefit amount increases to $10,000. It is important to note that Rosa's Group Critical Illness Insurance coverage ends once a claim has been paid. For full terms, limitations, exclusions, and definitions, the Certificate of Insurance should be consulted.",

      "summary": "Rosa's family has a history of heart disease, prompting her concern for her family's future welfare in the event of a heart attack. Despite having a medical insurance plan, Rosa is aware of potential out-of-pocket expenses such as deductibles and coinsurance. To mitigate these costs, Rosa and her husband John considered a Critical Illness Plan. This plan is designed to offset some of the financial burdens associated with critical health events.\n\nWhen Rosa experienced her first heart attack, she was rushed to the hospital. After receiving necessary care, Rosa accessed the member portal to download the Sirius CI Claim Form. She completed and submitted the form to the insurance company, which then verified the diagnosis and processed the claim.\n\nThe Critical Illness Insurance provides specific benefits based on the timing of the diagnosis. If the diagnosis occurs within the first year from the effective date, Rosa would receive a benefit amount of $2,500. If the diagnosis occurs after the first year, the benefit amount increases to $25,000. It is important to note that Rosa's Group Critical Illness Insurance would terminate once a claim has been paid. For full terms, limitations, exclusions, and definitions, reference to the Certificate of Insurance is advised.",

    "content": "---- Cover ----\n\nHello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on the Gap 10000 Plan. We'll walk through the plan's features and benefits that empower your health with financial peace of mind. Let's get started!\n\n---- Gap 10000 Overview ----\n\nThe Gap 10000 Plan is designed to manage out-of-pocket medical expenses through the United Business Association. \n\nIt includes Blanket Group Accident Insurance, which provides coverage for accidental death and dismemberment. \n\nAdditionally, the plan offers a Group Accident Medical Expense Benefit to cover accident-related medical costs. \n\nFor those diagnosed with a critical illness, the Group Critical Illness Insurance provides financial safety. \n\nThis plan is underwritten by Sirius America Insurance Company, ensuring reliable coverage.\n\n---- Key Features and Benefits ----\n\nLet's explore the key features and benefits of this plan.\n\nThe Blanket Group Accident Insurance offers financial protection in the event of accidental death or dismemberment. \n\nThe Group Accident Medical Expense Benefit helps alleviate unexpected medical expenses due to accidents. \n\nThe Group Critical Illness Insurance provides a financial safety net, allowing you to focus on recovery without financial stress. \n\nReliable coverage is provided through Sirius America Insurance Company, ensuring peace of mind.\n\n---- Cost Management Tools ----\n\nNow, let's discuss the cost management tools available with this plan.\n\nThe UBA Membership Portal, or UMP, is a key tool for managing your plan. \n\nThe Claim Filing System simplifies the process of submitting claims. \n\nCustomer Support Assistance is available to help with any questions or issues you may encounter.\n\n---- How UBA Membership Portal Works ----\n\nHere's how the UBA Membership Portal works.\n\nFirst, you enroll through the United Business Association. \n\nNext, you can access the member portal to obtain claim forms. \n\nSubmit your claims for processing, and receive Claim Verification through the UMP. \n\nYou can monitor the status of your claims online, ensuring efficient claim processing.\n\n---- Preventive Care and Wellness ----\n\nThe plan also includes preventive care and wellness services.\n\nYou have access to a 24-Hour Nurse Helpline for immediate health advice. \n\nLab Discounts Programs are available to help reduce costs on necessary tests. \n\nThe Gateway Medicard provides additional health support, enhancing your overall wellness.\n\n---- Telehealth Services ----\n\nLet's discuss the telehealth services included in the plan.\n\nVirtual Urgent Care is available for immediate medical needs. \n\nTalk Therapy Visits offer mental health support. \n\nBehavioral Health services are accessible, ensuring comprehensive care. \n\nYou have 24/7 Access to care, providing convenience and flexibility.\n\n---- Advocacy and Support Services ----\n\nThe plan also offers advocacy and support services.\n\nComprehensive healthcare advocacy is available to assist with navigating the healthcare system. \n\nClaim Filing assistance helps ensure your claims are processed smoothly. \n\nThe Member Portal offers various options for managing your plan. \n\nCustomer Support services are always ready to help with any inquiries.\n\n---- Gap 10000 Plan (One of Two) ----\n\nLet's examine our first plan tier.\n\nThe Gap 10000 Plan includes Blanket Group Accident Insurance, providing coverage for accidental death and dismemberment, and financial support for severe injuries. This is underwritten by Sirius America.\n\nThe Group Accident Medical Expense Benefit covers accident-related medical costs, helping to alleviate unexpected expenses.\n\nThe Group Critical Illness Insurance offers a financial safety net for critical illness, allowing you to focus on recovery without financial stress.\n\n---- Gap 10000 Plan (Two of Two) ----\n\nContinuing with our first plan tier.\n\nCoverage Exclusions and Limitations are important to note. This plan is not a replacement for major medical insurance, and specific terms and conditions apply.\n\nMembership Benefits include access to UBA resources, as well as networking and business support.\n\n---- Gap 25000 Plan (One of Two) ----\n\nNow, let's look at our second plan tier.\n\nThe Gap 25000 Plan offers Blanket Group Accident Insurance, covering accidental death and dismemberment, along with medical expense benefits and critical illness coverage.\n\nThe Group Critical Illness Insurance provides a lump sum benefit for critical illnesses, offering financial assistance during recovery.\n\nCoverage Conditions and Exclusions are present, with benefits being limited and subject to terms and conditions.\n\n---- Gap 25000 Plan (Two of Two) ----\n\nContinuing with our second plan tier.\n\nEligibility and Age Restrictions apply, with the plan available to members aged eighteen to sixty-four, and coverage ending at age sixty-five.\n\nState Availability varies, so it's important to check the availability of coverage in your region.\n\n---- Gap AME 10K+ Plan (One of Two) ----\n\nLet's move on to our third plan tier.\n\nThe Gap AME 10K+ Plan includes Group Accident Insurance, providing medical expense benefits and coverage for death and dismemberment.\n\nNon-Insurance Benefit Boost Services are available, including virtual urgent care and talk therapy visits.\n\nSupplemental Coverage enhances existing health plans but is not a substitute for major medical insurance.\n\n---- Gap AME 10K+ Plan (Two of Two) ----\n\nContinuing with our third plan tier.\n\nPlan Costs and Rates are as follows: the individual rate is seven dollars and seventy-five cents, while the family rate is nineteen dollars and thirty-seven cents.\n\nAdditional Benefits include free vitamins and prescription discounts, adding value to your plan.\n\n---- Comparing the Plans ----\n\nLet's compare the different tiers available.\n\nThe table shows that all three plans offer Accident Insurance. However, only the Gap 10000 and Gap 25000 include Critical Illness coverage. \n\nThe Medical Expense Benefit is ten thousand dollars for the Gap 10000 and Gap AME 10K+, while the Gap 25000 offers twenty-five thousand dollars. \n\nNon-Insurance Benefits are exclusive to the Gap AME 10K+. \n\nMonthly rates vary, with the Gap 10000 at six dollars, Gap 25000 at eight dollars and fifty-four cents, and Gap AME 10K+ at seven dollars and seventy-five cents for individuals.\n\n---- Definitions and Limitations ----\n\nLet's review important definitions and limitations.\n\nAccident Insurance is limited to accidents only and excludes sickness-related losses.\n\nCritical Illness Insurance covers specific conditions, and pre-existing conditions may apply.\n\nNon-Insurance Benefits are separate from insurance coverage and are subject to provider terms.\n\nState-Specific Exclusions mean coverage varies by state, so it's important to review the Certificate of Insurance.\n\n---- Key Takeaways and Reminders ----\n\nHere are the key points to remember.\n\nAccident Insurance benefits are included in all plans. \n\nCritical Illness coverage is available in the Gap 10000 and Gap 25000 plans. \n\nNon-Insurance Benefits are offered in the Gap AME 10K+ plan. \n\nMembership is required to access these benefits.\n\n---- Closing ----\n\nThank you for your time today.
