    "instructions": "# Access Health Instructions\n\n## Overview\nCreate a detailed presentation for the Access Health limited duration group short-term medical insurance plan. This presentation should highlight the flexible coverage options, the three distinct plan tiers, and the specific benefits and limitations of each plan.\n\n## Key Focus Areas\n- Emphasize the short-term nature of the coverage (up to 36 months)\n- Highlight the flexibility in deductible options ($500 to $10,000)\n- Detail the 80/20 coinsurance structure with limits of $2,000 or $4,000\n- Explain the PHCS network access and provider flexibility\n- Showcase the pre-existing waiver rider option\n\n## Plan Tiers\nEnsure all three plan tiers (Plan 1, Plan 2, Plan 3) are thoroughly explained with their specific benefits:\n- Plan 1: Fixed benefit amounts for hospital confinement, surgery, etc.\n- Plan 2: More comprehensive office visit coverage with unlimited visits\n- Plan 3: Similar to Plan 1 but with different deductible structures\n\n## Benefit Details\nBe precise about the benefit limits for each plan, including:\n- Hospital confinement limits ($1,500 per day for Plan 1)\n- Doctor visit copays ($25 for Plans 1 & 3, $15 for Plan 2)\n- Surgical services caps ($5,000 per surgery for Plan 1)\n- Specialty services like organ transplants ($50,000 per coverage period)\n- Mental health and therapy services\n\n## Limitations and Exclusions\nClearly communicate the important limitations:\n- 5-day waiting period for sickness\n- 30-day waiting period for cancer\n- 12-month pre-existing condition exclusion\n- Specific coverage caps for procedures like joint surgery ($3,000)\n- Excluded services like cosmetic surgery and infertility treatments\n\n## Target Audience\nThis presentation is for insurance agents and brokers who need to understand the Access Health plan to present it to potential clients. Focus on providing clear, factual information that helps them explain the plan's benefits and limitations accurately.\n\n## Tone and Style\n- Professional and informative\n- Factual rather than promotional\n- Clear about both benefits and limitations\n- Avoid using the word \"comprehensive\" as this is not a comprehensive health plan\n- Use precise dollar amounts and benefit limits\n\n## Special Instructions\n- Include a comparison table showing all three plans side-by-side\n- Use the benefit tables from pages 3 and 4 for accurate information\n- Highlight the limitations pages when discussing exclusions\n- Emphasize that this is not a replacement for major medical coverage\n- Include information about the NCE membership benefits\n"
