      "summary": "The MBR Plus program offers members significant discounts on all medical bills submitted by participating doctors or hospitals through a Reference Based Pricing system. The process begins with a recommendation to call MBR before visiting a provider to receive necessary documents and instructions, although this step is not mandatory. Members are required to pay a $25 pre-pay for primary care office visits and a $50 pre-pay for specialist office visits. After the visit, providers should mail the remaining medical bills to MBR for repricing.\n\nUpon submission of bills for repricing, both the member and the healthcare provider will receive a detailed Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from MBR via traditional mail. This document will outline the billed amount and any discounts applied. Members are advised to show their MBR card at the time of service and complete insurance claim forms to receive insured benefits. The MBR team can provide these forms and instructions on how to complete them.\n\nFinally, members should expect a final bill from their medical provider, which should match the amount due on the EOB already received. The insurance company may provide additional funds to help cover any outstanding balances. It is important to note that while MBR strives to lower medical bills through Reference Based Pricing and Direct Bill Negotiation, they cannot guarantee the outcome of any claim or the amount of savings. Medical providers may decline to honor this service.",

      "summary": "MBR Plus is a service that integrates medical bill repricing, healthcare advocacy, and bill negotiation, providing members with the flexibility to seek medical care from any licensed healthcare provider. Members are required to pay a $25 pre-pay for primary care office visits, with further details available on page 2. The service offers concierge-style healthcare advocacy, medical bill repricing, and direct bill negotiations, along with guidance on obtaining financial assistance. The mission of MBR is to assist members in navigating the complex healthcare system, ensuring access to high-quality care at competitive prices. The service includes bill negotiation to help members lower their medical expenses.\n\nThe dedicated support team at MBR is committed to guiding members through the process, from financial aid to direct bill negotiation. Although the outcome of claims or bills cannot be guaranteed, the team aims to make the experience as stress-free as possible. MBR utilizes a Reference Based Pricing System, which reprices healthcare bills to 150% to 200% of the Medicare Allowable Rates. This system is widely accepted in the Healthcare Self-Insured Group Marketplace, with over 70% of employer groups in America using it to reduce medical service rates. By employing this cost-containment method, MBR can achieve lower provider fees and reduce out-of-pocket expenses for members, often surpassing the savings offered by common PPO networks.",

Once bills are submitted for repricing, both the member and healthcare provider will receive a detailed Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from MBR, specifying the billed amount and any discounts applied.\n\nFinally, members should expect a final bill from their medical provider, aligning with the amount due on the EOB. Insurance companies may provide additional funds to cover outstanding balances. The MBR team is available to assist throughout the entire process. However, it is noted that while MBR strives to help, they cannot guarantee the outcome of any claim or the amount of savings on any bill, and medical providers may decline to honor this service.",

    "content": "---- Cover ----\n\nHello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on the MyChoice Plan. We'll walk through this plan's features and benefits, designed to enhance your healthcare experience and provide valuable support. Let's get started!\n\n---- MyChoice Plan Overview ----\n\nThe MyChoice Plan is dedicated to improving the lives of American workers through the Business Workers of America Association, or BWA. \n\nIt offers healthcare and wellness programs aimed at promoting better lifestyles. \n\nAdditionally, the plan provides educational support through scholarships and grants. \n\nFinancial assistance and guidance are also key components of this plan. \n\nFinally, advocacy and support services are available to help you navigate your healthcare journey.\n\n---- Key Features and Benefits ----\n\nLet's explore the key features and benefits of this plan.\n\nMedical bill repricing is a significant feature that helps manage healthcare costs. \n\nHealthcare advocacy is available to assist you in understanding and utilizing your benefits effectively. \n\nThe plan also offers financial assistance guidance to support your financial well-being. \n\nCash benefits, which vary by plan, provide additional financial support. \n\nPrescription savings are available through HealthWarehouse, offering cost-effective options for your medication needs.\n\n---- Cost Management Tools ----\n\nNow, let's discuss the cost management tools available with this plan.\n\nMBR Plus, or Medical Bill Repricing, is a tool designed to reduce your medical expenses. \n\nThe plan utilizes a reference-based pricing system to ensure fair pricing for healthcare services. \n\nConcierge healthcare advocacy support is available to assist you in navigating the healthcare system.\n\n---- How MBR Plus Works ----\n\nHere's how the MBR Plus system operates.\n\nFirst, you enroll through BWA. \n\nFor primary care visits, there is a twenty-five dollar pre-pay. \n\nSpecialist visits require a fifty dollar pre-pay. \n\nYou will receive an Explanation of Benefits, or EOB, detailing your coverage. \n\nSubmit your bills for repricing to potentially lower your costs. \n\nThis process aims to reduce your out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n---- Preventive Care and Wellness ----\n\nThe plan emphasizes preventive care and wellness.\n\nWellness visits are included to support your overall health. \n\nHealth programs are available for members to encourage healthy living. \n\nDirectLabs provides lab services to assist in monitoring your health.\n\n---- Telehealth Services ----\n\nLet's discuss the telehealth services offered.\n\nA twenty-four seven nurse hotline is available for immediate health concerns. \n\nThe online health manager provides tools to manage your health information. \n\nA health information library is accessible for educational resources. \n\nThese services ensure access to care anytime, anywhere.\n\n---- Advocacy and Support Services ----\n\nThe plan includes advocacy and support services.\n\nConcierge-style healthcare advocacy is available to guide you through your healthcare options. \n\nFinancial assistance guidance is provided to help manage your expenses. \n\nBill negotiation options are available to potentially reduce your medical costs. \n\nPersonalized advocacy support is offered to address your unique healthcare needs.\n\n---- Plan 1 (One of Two) ----\n\nLet's examine our first plan tier.\n\nInpatient hospital confinement offers one hundred dollars per day, up to ten days. \n\nIntensive care confinement provides two hundred dollars per day, also up to ten days. \n\nThe first day hospital admission benefit is one thousand dollars, available once per year.\n\n---- Plan 1 (Two of Two) ----\n\nContinuing with our first plan tier.\n\nAmbulance benefits include one hundred dollars for ground transport and one hundred dollars for air transport. \n\nEmergency room visits are covered at two hundred dollars per visit.\n\n---- Plan 2 (One of Two) ----\n\nNow, let's look at our second plan tier.\n\nInpatient hospital confinement offers three hundred dollars per day, up to ten days. \n\nIntensive care confinement provides five hundred dollars per day, also up to ten days. \n\nThe first day hospital admission benefit remains at one thousand dollars, available once per year.\n\n---- Plan 2 (Two of Two) ----\n\nContinuing with our second plan tier.\n\nAmbulance benefits include one hundred dollars for ground transport and two hundred dollars for air transport. \n\nEmergency room visits are covered at two hundred dollars per visit.\n\n---- Plan 3 (One of Two) ----\n\nNow, let's explore our third plan tier.\n\nInpatient hospital confinement offers three hundred dollars per day, up to ten days. \n\nIntensive care confinement provides five hundred dollars per day, also up to ten days. \n\nThe first day hospital admission benefit is one thousand dollars, available once per year.\n\n---- Plan 3 (Two of Two) ----\n\nContinuing with our third plan tier.\n\nAmbulance benefits include one hundred dollars for ground transport and three hundred dollars for air transport. \n\nEmergency room visits are covered at two hundred dollars per visit.\n\n---- Comparing Plan Tiers ----\n\nLet's compare the different tiers available.\n\nPlan one offers one hundred dollars per day for inpatient hospital confinement, while plans two and three offer three hundred dollars per day. \n\nIntensive care confinement is two hundred dollars per day in plan one, and five hundred dollars per day in plans two and three. \n\nThe first day hospital admission benefit is one thousand dollars across all plans. \n\nAmbulance benefits vary, with plan one offering one hundred dollars for both ground and air transport, plan two offering one hundred dollars for ground and two hundred dollars for air, and plan three offering one hundred dollars for ground and three hundred dollars for air. \n\nEmergency room visits are consistently covered at two hundred dollars per visit across all plans.\n\n---- Definitions and Limitations ----\n\nLet's review important definitions and limitations.\n\nInpatient hospital confinement provides a daily benefit for up to ten days, excluding rehab units, and is subject to an annual maximum. \n\nIntensive care confinement offers a daily benefit for up to ten days. \n\nThe first day hospital admission benefit is available once per calendar year. \n\nAmbulance benefits are limited to one trip per year, per type of transport.\n\n---- Key Takeaways and Reminders ----\n\nHere are the key points to remember.\n\nThe plan offers extensive coverage benefits to support your healthcare needs. \n\nAdvocacy and support services are included to assist you in navigating your healthcare journey. \n\nCost management tools are available to help manage your expenses. \n\nEligibility criteria must be met to enroll in the plan.\n\n---- Closing ----\n\nThank you for your
