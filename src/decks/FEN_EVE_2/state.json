ICU confinement benefits are similarly structured. Hospital benefits include emergency room visits, with coverage from $50 in Plan 500 to $100 in Plan 1000+. Plan 1000+ offers additional hospital admission benefits of $1000.\n\nProcedure benefits cover surgeries with a maximum of three days per certificate year, shared between inpatient and outpatient services. Anesthesia is covered at 25% across all plans. Outpatient benefits include lab, X-rays, advanced diagnostics, and physician's office visits, with coverage amounts increasing from Plan 500 to Plan 1000+.\n\nThe document also highlights specific limitations, such as the exclusion of chiropractic or acupuncture coverage and the absence of a cancellation age.
