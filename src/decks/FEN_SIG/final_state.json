      "summary": "The Sigma Care Plus plan is associated with the National Congress of Employers (NCE), which supports small and medium-sized businesses in America through networking and advocacy. NCE provides its members with reliable services and benefits, regardless of their circumstances. Membership offers valuable benefits and superior customer service, with enrollment opportunities available for individuals and families. Upon successful application and payment, members receive a Purchase Confirmation E-mail from NCE Member Services, which includes the NCE Membership Handbook, a sample certificate of insurance, and additional information. Members also receive registration and login instructions for their personalized Member Services Portal. The fulfillment packet, containing the handbook and personalized Certificate of Insurance, is mailed within 7-10 business days after enrollment, pending carrier approval.\n\nThe plan operates on a monthly membership basis, with billing statements reflecting the monthly premium for health benefits and NCE association membership. The initial premium draft includes a non-refundable, one-time enrollment fee processed on the day of enrollment. Future drafts occur monthly, approximately every 30 days. Payment options include credit cards and bank automatic drafts. The Limited Benefit Medical plan is not a major medical plan and is not intended to replace one. It provides basic insurance coverage with specific caps for services. It is suitable for those looking to supplement a higher deductible major medical plan. Eligibility is for adult members aged 18-65 and dependent children aged 1-25.",

    "content": "---- Cover ----\n\nHello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on the Sigma Care Plus Limited Medical Benefit Plan. We'll walk through the plan's features and benefits, designed to support your healthcare needs effectively. Let's get started!\n\n---- Sigma Care Plus Overview ----\n\nThe Sigma Care Plus plan offers a detailed comparison of benefit plans through the National Congress of Employers, or NCE. \n\nIt includes Hospital Confinement Benefits for various situations, ensuring you have support when you need it most. \n\nThe plan also provides Primary and Specialty Care support tools, making healthcare more accessible. \n\nEmergency Room and Surgery Benefits are structured to offer financial assistance during critical times. \n\nAdditionally, the plan includes Supplemental Accident and Critical Illness support, which varies by plan.\n\n---- Key Features and Benefits ----\n\nLet's explore the key features and benefits of this plan.\n\nHospital Confinement Benefits are a core component, providing financial support during hospital stays. \n\nPrimary and Specialty Care Benefits ensure you have access to necessary medical services. \n\nEmergency Room and Surgery Benefits offer structured financial assistance for urgent and planned procedures. \n\nSupplemental Accident and Critical Illness Benefits vary by plan, providing additional support when needed.\n\nPrescription and Dental Access is available through the Aetna Dental Access Network, enhancing your healthcare options.\n\n---- Cost Management Tools ----\n\nNow, let's discuss the cost management tools available with this plan.\n\nThe GapAfford Plus Program, or GAP, is designed to help manage healthcare expenses. \n\nA Discount Card System is in place to provide savings on various medical services. \n\nMedical Bill Negotiations Support is available to assist with reducing out-of-pocket costs.\n\n---- How GapAfford Plus Works ----\n\nHere's how the GapAfford Plus Program operates.\n\nFirst, you enroll through the National Congress of Employers. \n\nYou will receive a discount card for prescriptions, helping to lower medication costs. \n\nThe program also provides access to dental and vision savings, enhancing your overall healthcare benefits. \n\nAfter enrollment, you will receive a Purchase Confirmation E-mail, confirming your participation in the GAP program. \n\nAdditional benefits are accessible through this program, offering further financial relief. \n\nUltimately, the program is designed to help you manage out-of-pocket expenses effectively.\n\n---- Preventive Care and Wellness ----\n\nPreventive care and wellness are integral to maintaining good health.\n\nThe plan includes Vision and Dental Services, ensuring comprehensive care. \n\nAlternative Medicine Programs are available, offering diverse healthcare options. \n\nThe OUTLOOK Vision Network provides vision care, supporting your eye health needs.\n\n---- Telehealth Services ----\n\nTelehealth services offer convenient access to healthcare.\n\nA 24/7 Health Information Line is available, providing round-the-clock support. \n\nThe Nurse Help Line offers professional medical advice when you need it. \n\nChiropractic Care is accessible through telehealth, expanding your treatment options. \n\nOverall, telehealth ensures you have access to care from the comfort of your home.\n\n---- Advocacy and Support Services ----\n\nAdvocacy and support services are essential for navigating healthcare.\n\nThe plan offers healthcare advocacy to assist with understanding your benefits. \n\nEnrollment assistance is available to guide you through the process. \n\nMembership options provide flexibility in choosing the right plan for you. \n\nCustomer service support is always ready to help with any questions or concerns.\n\n---- Plan 100 (One of Two) ----\n\nLet's examine our first plan tier, Plan 100.\n\nHospital Confinement Benefits provide one hundred dollars per day, with a maximum of thirty days. \n\nPrimary Care Benefits offer fifty dollars per day, with a maximum of three visits. \n\nEmergency Room Benefits are not available under this plan.\n\n---- Plan 100 (Two of Two) ----\n\nContinuing with Plan 100.\n\nSurgery Benefits provide four hundred dollars per day, with a maximum of three days. \n\nSupplemental Accident Benefits offer five hundred dollars per admission, providing additional financial support.\n\n---- Plan 200 (One of Two) ----\n\nNow, let's look at our second plan tier, Plan 200.\n\nHospital Confinement Benefits increase to two hundred dollars per day, with a maximum of thirty days. \n\nPrimary Care Benefits remain at fifty dollars per day, with a maximum of three visits. \n\nEmergency Room Benefits are not available under this plan.\n\n---- Plan 200 (Two of Two) ----\n\nContinuing with Plan 200.\n\nSurgery Benefits remain at four hundred dollars per day, with a maximum of three days. \n\nSupplemental Accident Benefits continue to offer five hundred dollars per admission.\n\n---- Comparing Plan Tiers ----\n\nLet's compare the different tiers available.\n\nThe table outlines the benefits for each plan tier, from Plan 100 to Plan 1000. \n\nHospital Confinement Benefits range from one hundred dollars per day in Plan 100 to one thousand dollars per day in Plan 1000. \n\nPrimary Care Benefits are consistent at fifty dollars per day across most plans, with Plan 1000 offering seventy-five to one hundred dollars per day. \n\nEmergency Room Benefits are not available in the lower tiers but increase in higher tiers. \n\nSurgery Benefits start at four hundred dollars per day in the lower tiers and reach up to one thousand five hundred dollars per day in Plan 1000. \n\nSupplemental Accident Benefits remain consistent at five hundred dollars per admission across all plans.\n\n---- Definitions and Limitations ----\n\nLet's review important definitions and limitations.\n\nMedical Necessity refers to treatments that are not medically necessary, not prescribed by a doctor, or considered experimental. \n\nExclusions include dental procedures unless they are accidental and elective procedures. \n\nPre-existing Conditions have a twelve-month exclusion period, with exceptions for newborns and adopted children. \n\nThere is a thirty-day waiting period for sickness, and specific conditions apply for voluntary abortion coverage.\n\n---- Key Takeaways and Reminders ----\n\nHere are the key points to remember.\n\nHospital Confinement benefits provide financial support during hospital stays. \n\nPrimary and Specialty Care are included, ensuring access to necessary medical services. \n\nEmergency Room and Surgery benefits offer structured financial assistance. \n\nEnrollment is required to access these benefits.\n\n---- Closing ----\n\nThank you for your time today. We hope this information helps you make informed decisions about your health coverage. Continue to be great!",
