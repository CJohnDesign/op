      "summary": "The Medical Bill Repricer is a key feature in the Managed Care Benefit Package, designed to simplify the healthcare billing process for members. It addresses the complexity of medical bills, which often include various charges such as hospital room fees, surgical fees, and specialist fees. The Repricer uses 'Reference Based Pricing' to manage costs, allowing payments between 150% to 200% of Medicare Allowable Rates. This method is widely accepted by doctors and medical facilities, helping to lower provider fees and out-of-pocket costs for members.\n\nMembers can benefit from a $25 pre-pay for doctor office visits or a $50 pre-pay for specialist visits, without the need to visit a network doctor. The service includes assistance in locating providers and setting appointments. After insurance claims are settled, any remaining balance is the member's responsibility. The Repricer also offers an Advocacy Service, which helps members understand their benefits, file insurance claims, and negotiate with providers to reduce outstanding balances.\n\nThe plan emphasizes flexibility, allowing members to choose their own doctors and not be restricted to network providers. The advocacy service further supports members by setting up payment plans or negotiating to eliminate balances owed after insurance payments.",

    "content": "---- Cover ----\n\nHello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on the Basic Core and Basic Core-Plus Insurance Plans. We'll walk through the details and benefits of these plans, designed to provide essential healthcare solutions. Let's get started!\n\n---- Basic Core and Basic Core-Plus Overview ----\n\nThe Basic Core and Basic Core-Plus plans\n\nare offered through American Public Life Insurance Company. \n\nThe Basic Core plan is an Indemnity Insurance, which means you receive a set payment amount for covered services. \n\nThe Basic Core-Plus plan is a Managed Care option, providing structured healthcare management. \n\nBoth plans have no waiting or exclusion period for pre-existing conditions, ensuring immediate access to benefits. \n\nHowever, please note that there is no coverage for pregnancy under these plans.\n\nNow, let's explore the key features and benefits.\n\n---- Key Features and Benefits ----\n\nThese plans offer significant hospital admission benefits. \n\nYou receive five hundred dollars per day for hospital admission, with a maximum of one day. \n\nFor hospital daily confinement, the benefit is one hundred dollars per day, up to ten days. \n\nEmergency room visits are covered at fifty dollars per day, with a maximum of one day. \n\nFor urgent care and physician office visits, the benefit is fifty dollars per day, up to three days. \n\nAdditionally, there are extra benefits such as a free prescription club with a discount Rx card. \n\nYou also have access to no-cost telemedicine virtual doctor visits.\n\nLet's move on to the cost management tools available with these plans.\n\n---- Cost Management Tools ----\n\nThe plans include a Medical Bill Repricer, or MBR, to help manage expenses. \n\nThey also utilize a Reference Based Pricing system to ensure fair pricing for services. \n\nAdvocacy services support is available to assist with navigating healthcare needs.\n\nNext, we'll discuss how the Medical Bill Repricer works.\n\n---- How Medical Bill Repricer Works ----\n\nTo use the Medical Bill Repricer, you first enroll through American Public Life Insurance Company. \n\nYou can choose any doctor with a twenty-five dollar prepay for primary care visits. \n\nFor specialist visits, there is a fifty dollar prepay. \n\nThe system provides Reference Based Pricing, or RBP, to ensure cost-effective care. \n\nYou will receive assistance in locating providers and setting appointments. \n\nThis tool offers flexibility in choosing doctors, enhancing your healthcare experience.\n\nLet's look at preventive care and wellness options.\n\n---- Preventive Care and Wellness ----\n\nThe plans include free prescription club services to help manage medication costs. \n\nThere is a Patient Assistance Program available for brand name medications. \n\nAdditionally, Walmart provides discounted diabetic insulin, supporting your wellness needs.\n\nNow, let's explore telehealth services.\n\n---- Telehealth Services ----\n\nTelehealth services offer unlimited virtual doctor visits, available twenty-four seven. \n\nYou can have live video consultations with healthcare professionals. \n\nImmediate prescription fills are available at local pharmacies. \n\nWith the Free Prescription Club ID, you can access no-cost generic medications.\n\nLet's move on to advocacy and support services.\n\n---- Advocacy and Support Services ----\n\nThe plans provide comprehensive healthcare advocacy to assist you. \n\nYou will receive help in understanding your benefits and making the most of them. \n\nProvider negotiation options are available to ensure fair pricing. \n\nSupport is also provided for setting up payment plans, easing financial concerns.\n\nNow, let's examine our first plan tier, the Basic Core Plan.\n\n---- Basic Core Plan (1/2) ----\n\nThe Basic Core Plan offers hospital benefits of five hundred dollars per day for admission. \n\nFor daily confinement, the benefit is one hundred dollars per day. \n\nEmergency room visits are covered at fifty

the flexibility to choose any doctor, with assistance in locating providers.\n\nNow, let's look at our second plan tier, the Basic Core-Plus Plan.\n\n---- Basic Core-Plus Plan (1/2) ----\n\nThe Basic

days. \n\nBoth plans provide essential benefits, with the Core-Plus offering additional features like free generic medications.\n\nLet's review important definitions and limitations.\n\n---- Definitions and Limitations ----\n\nFor pre-existing conditions, there is no waiting period and no exclusion period. \n\nHowever, pregnancy is not covered under these plans. \n\nProvider flexibility allows you to choose any doctor, with no network restrictions. \n\nAdvocacy services assist with benefits and provider negotiations. \n\nCost management is supported through Reference Based Pricing and the Medical Bill Repricer.\n\nHere are the key points to remember.\n\n---- Key Takeaways and Reminders ----\n\nBoth plans include hospital and emergency benefits. \n\nTelemedicine and prescription benefits are available to enhance your healthcare access. \n\nAdvocacy and support services are provided to assist with healthcare navigation. \n\nThere are no network restrictions, offering you
