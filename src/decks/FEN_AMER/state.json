It includes allowances for exams, lenses, frames, and various types of lenses such as single, bifocal, trifocal, lenticular, and progressive. All these are subject to maximum allowances. The plan specifies that there are no deductibles for exams, lenses, and frames, while a lifetime deductible of $100 applies to other services. Members are advised to submit claims within 90 days of the date of service to ensure benefits are considered. \n\nThe dental rewards section explains how members can increase their annual maximum benefit by submitting at least one dental claim each year. If total dental benefits paid are under $500, members qualify for over $250 in rewards for the following year. An additional $100 PPO bonus is available when visiting an Ameritas network provider. Accumulated rewards can reach a maximum of $1000, but if no claim is submitted, rewards reset to zero. \n\nProvider flexibility and network savings are highlighted, allowing members to choose any dentist, whether in-network or out-of-network, without needing claim forms for in-network visits. The Ameritas dental network offers significant savings, with costs typically 30% below average. \n\nThe late entrant section details that members who enroll after initially declining coverage will face a 12-month waiting period for most benefits, except for evaluations, prophylaxis, and fluoride application. After this period, full benefits become accessible.",

Provisions support. \n\nNext, we'll discuss how the Dental Rewards Program works.\n\n---- How Dental Rewards Program Works ----\n\nTo participate in the Dental Rewards Program, enroll through Ameritas. \n\nSubmit at least one dental claim each year. \n\nIf the benefits paid are under five hundred dollars, you qualify for rewards. \n\nYou'll receive two hundred fifty dollars in rewards through the DRP. \n\nThere's an additional one hundred dollar PPO bonus for network visits. \n\nYou can accumulate up to one thousand dollars in rewards. \n\nNow, let's look at preventive care and wellness.\n\n---- Preventive Care and Wellness ----\n\nThe plan offers routine exams services, \n\nprophylaxis programs, \n\nand Ameritas provides both dental and vision care. \n\nLet's move on to telehealth services.\n\n---- Telehealth Services ----\n\nTelehealth services include prescription savings, \n\nvision discounts, \n\neyewear savings, \n\nand access to care. \n\nNow, let's discuss advocacy and support services.\n\n---- Advocacy and Support Services ----\n\nThe plan provides healthcare advocacy, \n\ncustomer service assistance, \n\nflexible provider options, \n\nand network savings support. \n\nLet's examine our first plan tier, Type 1 Preventive.\n\n---- Plan Tier 1 (One of Two) ----\n\nType 1 Preventive includes routine exams with one hundred percent coverage and no deductible. \n\nBitewing X-rays are also covered at one hundred percent with no deductible. \n\nCleanings are covered at one hundred percent with no deductible. \n\nContinuing with our first plan tier.\n\n---- Plan Tier 1 (Two of Two) ----\n\nThere is no waiting period for Type 1 Preventive, offering immediate coverage. \n\nThe annual maximum is one thousand dollars per person. \n\nNow, let's look at our second plan tier, Type 2 Basic.\n\n---- Plan Tier 2 (One of Two) ----\n\nType 2 Basic covers restorative amalgams at one hundred percent with a fifty dollar deductible. \n\nComposites are also covered at one hundred percent with a fifty dollar deductible. \n\nNonsurgical endodontics are covered at one hundred percent with a fifty dollar deductible. \n\nContinuing with our second plan tier.\n\n---- Plan Tier 2 (Two of Two) ----\n\nSimple extractions are covered at one hundred percent with a fifty dollar deductible. \n\nThe annual maximum is one thousand dollars per person. \n\nNow, let's look at our third plan tier, Type 3 Major.\n\n---- Plan Tier 3 (One of Two) ----\n\nType 3 Major includes surgical extractions with one hundred percent coverage and a fifty dollar deductible. \n\nCrowns are covered at one hundred percent with a fifty dollar deductible. \n\nProsthodontics are covered at one hundred percent with a fifty dollar deductible. \n\nContinuing with our third plan

deductible and maximum allowances. \n\nProgressive lenses have maximum allowances. \n\nContinuing with the Vision Plan.\n\n---- Vision Plan (Two of Two) ----\n\nNetwork savings offer thirty-five percent on eyewear at Walmart. \n\nThere is a lifetime deductible of one hundred dollars for other services. \n\nLet's compare the different tiers available.\n\n---- Comparing Plan Tiers ----\n\nIn this table, you can see the comparison of features across the plan tiers. \n\nType 1 Preventive, Type 2 Basic, and Type 3 Major all offer one hundred percent coverage with varying deductibles. \n\nThe Vision Plan provides maximum allowances with no deductible. \n\nEach plan tier has an annual maximum of one thousand dollars, except for the Vision Plan. \n\nNetwork savings are available across all tiers, and there are no waiting periods. \n\nLet's review important definitions and limitations.\n\n---- Definitions and Limitations ----\n\nCoverage limits include a one thousand dollar maximum combined for dental and vision, with no exceedance. \n\nLate entrant provisions require a twelve-month waiting period with limited benefits. \n\nNetwork savings offer thirty percent below average for in-network services. \n\nClaims must be submitted within ninety days to ensure benefits. \n\nHere are the key points to remember.\n\n---- Key Takeaways and Reminders ----\n\nThe FUSION Plan offers
