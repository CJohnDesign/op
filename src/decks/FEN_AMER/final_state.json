      "summary": "The FUSION plan combines dental and eye care benefits into a single, easy-to-administer package. This plan integrates the annual maximum between dental and vision plans, allowing members to use up to $1,000 toward any covered dental expense and up to $100 toward any covered eye care expense. The total benefits paid between the two coverages will not exceed $1,000. The dental plan benefits are categorized into three types: Type 1 Preventive, Type 2 Basic, and Type 3 Major, all with no waiting period. Type 1 Preventive covers routine exams, bitewing X-rays, and cleanings at 100%. Type 2 Basic includes restorative amalgams, composites, nonsurgical endodontics, and simple extractions, also at 100%. Type 3 Major covers surgical extractions, nonsurgical periodontics, crowns, surgical endodontics, surgical periodontics, and prosthodontics at 100% as well.\n\nThe deductible for Type 1 services is $0, while for Type 2 and 3 services, it is $50 per person per calendar year, with a family maximum of $150 per calendar year. The benefit year maximum for all types is $1,000 per person, per calendar year. The claims allowance is based on the maximum covered expense, with in-network allowances being discounted fees. This plan provides a structured approach to managing dental and eye care expenses, ensuring members have access to necessary preventive and major services without waiting periods.",

      "summary": "This page outlines the vision and dental plan benefits available to members, including specific allowances and frequencies for various services. Vision plan benefits are subject to the FUSION plan design, with allowances for exams, lenses, and frames, all subject to maximums. Specific lens types such as bifocal, trifocal, and progressive are also covered under these maximums. The plan includes a lifetime deductible of $0 for certain services. Members are encouraged to submit claims within 90 days of the date of service to ensure consideration by the plan.\n\nThe dental rewards program allows members to grow their annual maximum benefit by submitting at least one dental claim per year. If total dental benefits paid are under $500, members can carry over $250 in rewards to the following year. Additional rewards are available for using Ameritas network providers, with a potential maximum reward accumulation of $1000. However, if no dental claim is submitted within a year, rewards are reset.\n\nProvider flexibility is emphasized, allowing members to choose any dentist, with network dentists offering savings up to 30% below regional averages. The Ameritas dental network is extensive, providing over 428,000 access points nationwide. Late entrants, those who enroll after initially declining, face a 12-month waiting period for most benefits, except for evaluations, cleanings, and fluoride applications.",
