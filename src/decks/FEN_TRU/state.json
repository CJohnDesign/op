The document emphasizes adherence to CDC recommendations for immunization schedules.\n\nAdditionally, the document outlines exclusions applicable to the benefits offered under this plan. Exclusions include office visits, physical examinations, immunizations, and tests required solely for purposes such as sports, camp, employment, and legal proceedings. Other exclusions cover routine foot care, dental procedures, cosmetic surgeries unless medically necessary, and any medical service not explicitly provided in the plan. The plan also excludes coverage for any injury related to employment or any claims covered by a Worker's Compensation policy. These exclusions are clearly defined to ensure participants understand the limitations of their coverage.",

It specifies that any claims for services received outside the United States are not covered, except for certain claims by veterans. Claims for services not deemed medically necessary or those not contracted within a PPO network are excluded. Additionally, any charges reimbursed by public health programs are not covered. Claims related to acts of war or terrorism, and those for eyeglasses, hearing aids, or abortion services are excluded unless specified in the schedule of benefits.\n\nThe document further details that claims for custodial care, experimental treatments, and services related to suicide or illegal acts are not covered. Procedures for changing one's physical anatomy, fertility treatments, and obesity-related surgeries are also excluded unless explicitly covered. Claims for services from non-healthcare providers, genetic testing, and organ transplants are not covered unless specified. The document lists several specific treatments and services, such as chiropractic care, dialysis, and acupuncture, that are excluded from coverage.\n\nThe exclusions extend to alternative medicine, dental and vision care for children, and non-emergency care outside the U.S. Pregnancy-related services and routine well-baby care are also not covered while inpatient. The purpose of these exclusions is to provide clarity on what is not covered under the plan, ensuring no assumptions are made about coverage based on the absence of exclusions.",
