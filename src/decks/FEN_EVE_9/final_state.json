    "content": "---- Cover ----\n\nHello, everyone! Thank you for joining today's session on the Everest Reinsurance Group Fixed Indemnity Insurance. We'll walk through this plan's features and benefits, designed to provide predictable benefits for your healthcare needs. Let's get started!\n\n---- Everest Reinsurance Overview ----\n\nThe Everest Reinsurance Group Fixed Indemnity Insurance is offered through NCE. \n\nThis plan provides Fixed Indemnity Insurance, which means you receive a set payment amount for specific medical services. \n\nIt includes access to the Multiplan PPO Network and various support tools. \n\nWith a wide range of healthcare providers available through the network, you can enjoy a structured approach to healthcare coverage.\n\nNow, let's explore the key features and benefits of this plan.\n\n---- Key Features and Benefits ----\n\nThis plan offers fixed payments, providing you with predictable healthcare expenses. \n\nIt serves as supplemental coverage, helping to reduce out-of-pocket costs. \n\nThe plan ensures direct payment of benefits, with a fast claims process that varies by plan. \n\nAdditionally, the Multiplan PPO Network through Everest enhances your access to healthcare services.\n\nLet's move on to the cost management tools available with this plan.\n\n---- Cost Management Tools ----\n\nThe Multiplan PPO Network, or MPN, is a key component of this plan. \n\nIt features a direct payment system, simplifying the payment process for covered services. \n\nFast claims support is also available, ensuring that your claims are processed efficiently.\n\nNext, we'll discuss how the Multiplan PPO Network works.\n\n---- How Multiplan PPO Network Works ----\n\nTo begin, you enroll through NCE. \n\nOnce enrolled, you gain access to a wide range of providers within the network. \n\nYou can utilize network discounts to further reduce your healthcare costs. \n\nUpon enrollment, you will receive an MPN card. \n\nPresent this card at your provider's office to benefit from reduced out-of-pocket costs.\n\nNow, let's look at the preventive care and wellness options.\n\n---- Preventive Care and Wellness ----\n\nThe plan includes routine checkup services to help maintain your health. \n\nWellness programs are also available, offering initiatives to support your well-being. \n\nThe Multiplan PPO Network provides access to a variety of care options to support your health journey.\n\nLet's explore the telehealth services next.\n\n---- Telehealth Services ----\n\nWith this plan, you have 24/7 access to healthcare professionals. \n\nVirtual consultations are available, allowing you to connect with providers from the comfort of your home. \n\nRemote monitoring services are also offered, providing convenient access to care when you need it.\n\nNow, let's discuss the advocacy and support services.\n\n---- Advocacy and Support Services ----\n\nThe plan includes personalized healthcare advocacy to assist you in navigating your healthcare needs. \n\nClaims assistance support is available to help with any questions or issues you may encounter. \n\nYou can explore various benefit options to find the best fit for your needs. \n\nProvider support services are also included, ensuring you have the help you need.\n\nLet's examine our first plan tier, Plan 100.\n\n---- Plan 100 (One of Two) ----\n\nPlan 100 offers confinement benefits, including thirty days per confinement and ninety days per certificate year. \n\nHospital confinement benefits are set at one hundred dollars, while ICU confinement is two hundred dollars. \n\nHospital benefits include coverage for two emergency room visits per certificate year. \n\nOutpatient benefits cover three physician's office visits per certificate year.\n\nContinuing with Plan 100, let's look at the procedure benefits.\n\n---- Plan 100 (Two of Two) ----\n\nPlan 100 does not include coverage for surgery or anesthesia. \n\nLab and X-ray services are also not covered under this plan.\n\nNow, let's look at our second plan tier, Plan 200.\n\n---- Plan 200 (One of Two) ----\n\nPlan 200 provides confinement benefits similar to Plan 100, with thirty days per confinement and ninety days per certificate year. \n\nHospital confinement benefits are two hundred dollars, and ICU confinement is also two hundred dollars. \n\nHospital benefits include two emergency room visits per certificate year. \n\nOutpatient benefits cover X-rays and labs for four covered days per certificate year, advanced diagnostics, and three physician's office visits per certificate year.\n\nContinuing with Plan 200, let's explore the procedure benefits.\n\n---- Plan 200 (Two of Two) ----\n\nPlan 200 does not include coverage for surgery or anesthesia. \n\nHowever, lab and X-ray services are covered at fifty dollars each.\n\nNow, let's look at our third plan tier, Plan 300.\n\n---- Plan 300 (One of Two) ----\n\nPlan 300 offers confinement benefits with thirty days per confinement and ninety days per certificate year. \n\nHospital confinement benefits are three hundred dollars, and ICU confinement is also three hundred dollars. \n\nHospital benefits include two emergency room visits per certificate year. \n\nOutpatient benefits cover three physician's office visits per certificate year.\n\nContinuing with Plan 300, let's examine the procedure benefits.\n\n---- Plan 300 (Two of Two) ----\n\nPlan 300 includes coverage for surgery and anesthesia at twenty-five percent. \n\nLab and X-ray services are not covered under this plan.\n\nLet's compare the different tiers available.\n\n---- Comparing the Plans ----\n\nIn this table, we compare the features of Plan 100, Plan 200, and Plan 300. \n\nAll plans have a twelve-month exclusion period for pre-existing conditions and are guaranteed issue. \n\nConfinement benefits are consistent across all plans, with thirty days per confinement and ninety days per certificate year. \n\nHospital confinement benefits range from one hundred dollars in Plan 100 to three hundred dollars in Plan 300. \n\nICU confinement benefits are two hundred dollars in Plans 100 and 200, and three hundred dollars in Plan 300. \n\nEmergency room benefits are fifty dollars across all plans. \n\nPlan 300 includes procedure benefits for surgery and anesthesia at twenty-five percent, while Plans 100 and 200 do not. \n\nOutpatient benefits vary, with Plan 200 offering additional coverage for X-rays, labs, and advanced diagnostics.\n\nLet's review important definitions and limitations.\n\n---- Definitions and Limitations ----\n\nPre-existing conditions have a twelve-month exclusion period, applying to conditions treated prior to coverage. \n\nCoverage limits are specified amounts, and policy terms may vary by state. \n\nExclusions include no coverage for extreme sports injuries and cosmetic surgery unless medically necessary. \n\nAdditional limitations include no foreign travel coverage unless it's an emergency and excludes services by family members.\n\nHere are the key points to remember.\n\n---- Key Takeaways and Reminders ----\n\nThe plan offers fixed indemnity benefits, providing predictable healthcare expenses. \n\nIt includes access to the Multiplan PPO Network, enhancing your healthcare options. \n\nDirect payment benefits simplify the claims process. \n\nEnrollment is required to access these benefits.\n\nThank you for your time today. We hope this information helps you make informed decisions about your health coverage.
