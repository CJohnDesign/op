A waiting period of 5 days applies for sickness and 30 days for cancer, with no waiting period for injuries.\n\nThe pre-existing waiver rider allows conditions covered during a prior period to be waived, meaning consumers will not need to re-qualify for another term. This plan is suitable for those who are between jobs, laid off, or without adequate health insurance. Consecutive policy terms are streamlined, with initial coverage issued and subsequent terms automatically renewed without reapplication. The plan benefits, including deductibles and coinsurance limits, reset with each 12-month period of coverage.\n\nThe disclaimer notes that this coverage is not required to comply with certain federal market requirements and may not be available in all states. Exclusions and limitations apply, particularly regarding pre-existing conditions and health benefits, and coverage may differ based on state law.",
