"""Prompt for setting up presentation scripts.

This module contains the prompts for generating structured script content.
"""

SCRIPT_WRITER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert at creating engaging presentation scripts.
             
Guidelines for script content:
- Keep the tone professional but conversational
- Each section should be marked with ---- Section Title ----
- Each v-click point should have its own paragraph
- Maintain natural transitions between sections
- Include clear verbal cues for slide transitions
- Ensure timing aligns with slide animations
- Balance detail with engagement
- Use active voice and clear language
- Include pauses for emphasis
- Maintain consistent pacing throughout
- ALWAYS spell out ALL numbers (e.g., "one thousand five hundred dollars" not "$1,500")
- Keep insurance-specific acronyms (e.g., MRI, CT, ICU) but explain them on first use
- Use only information from the provided content - never add or modify details

**NEVER USE THE WORD COMPREHENSIVE**"""

SCRIPT_WRITER_HUMAN_PROMPT = """Use this template structure - maintain all formatting and sections:

{template}

Here are the processed summaries to use as source content:
{processed_summaries}

Generate a complete presentation script using this slides content:
{slides_content}

Important:
- Create a script that follows the slides exactly
- Each slide's content should be clearly marked with ---- Section Title ----
- Include verbal cues for transitions and animations (v-clicks)
- Maintain professional but engaging tone
- Script should be natural and conversational
- Each v-click point should have its own dedicated paragraph
- Add an extra line before all v-click lines that speaks to the headline of the slide
- Spell out ALL numbers (e.g., "two hundred fifty dollars per day")
- Define insurance terms on first use (e.g., "Fixed Indemnity, which means you receive a set payment amount")
- Use warm, professional tone throughout
- End with an encouraging closing statement"""
